- **Knowledge platform inter- and trans-disciplinary research @ NWO**: <br>
  Daniël Lakens and Krist Vaesen were part of a pilot research project carried out at the Dutch Research Council (NWO). The project was aimed at improving the procedures the council uses to review grant proposals. More specifically, the project examined and tested various changes to these procedures such that they were better geared towards evaluating inter- and trans-disciplinary research. Parts of the results are described in [Schölvinck et al](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvae049/7889019) (2024).
