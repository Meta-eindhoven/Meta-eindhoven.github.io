- [Nullius in Verba](https://nulliusinverba.podbean.com/_) (Podcast): Nullius in Verba is a podcast about science—what it is and what it could be. It is hosted by Smriti Mehta from UC Berkeley and Daniël Lakens from Eindhoven University of Technology. They draw inspiration from the book Novum Organum, written in 1620 by Francis Bacon, which laid the foundations of the modern scientific method. The title of the podcast—meaning “Take nobody’s word for it”—comes from the motto of the Royal Society. The podcast series has nearly 50 episodes, and a loyal audience of about 2,000 subscribers.
