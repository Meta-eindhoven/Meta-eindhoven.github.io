Our members, Krist Vaesen, Daniël Lakens, and Sajedeh Rasti recently gave an interview with Cursor -- TU/e’s independent news medium -- about our mission at META/e and how metascience can help improve the way science is done.

In the piece, they explain how META/e is a home for researchers working on open science, team science, reproducibility, and responsible AI, highlighting initiatives like the Paul Meehl Graduate School and our master’s course on assessing scientific quality. They also call for systemic change in academia from competition and “publish or perish” to collaboration, robust knowledge, and better incentives.
