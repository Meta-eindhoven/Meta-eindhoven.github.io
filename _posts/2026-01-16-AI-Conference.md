This year, we're hosting a conference on the use of technology and AI-based tools in peer review, grant evaluation, and research assessment. Taking place on **June 5**, it addresses how these technologies are being introduced into review processes, what problems they are meant to solve, and what new risks they may create for research quality, fairness, and accountability.
 
The event aims to critically examining practical experiences, emerging norms, and governance questions around technology-assisted review. Through exchange between experts from research, funding, publishing, policy, and science journalism, the conference seeks to clarify where technology can genuinely support evaluation processes and where clear boundaries, oversight, or restraint are needed to safeguard trust and integrity in science.
