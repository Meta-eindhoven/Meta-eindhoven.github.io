We’re excited to announce the launch of our brand-new website—a space designed to inform you about the activities of the Eindhoven Meta-Science Center (META/e in short). Here, you’ll find insights into the education we provide, the research we carry out, and the work we do regarding public outreach and science policy. Connect with our team, explore our resources, and stay tuned for updates!
