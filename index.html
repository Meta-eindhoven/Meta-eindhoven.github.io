The Eindhoven Meta-Science Center (META/e) is dedicated to the scientific study of science itself. Using scientific methodologies, META/e aims to find and promote ways of improving scientific practices, and this at the level of individual scientists, research groups, disciplines and the scientific community at large. It achieves this aim through <a href="education.html" title="Education">education</a>, <a href="research.html" title="Research">research</a>, <a href="outreach.html" title="outreach">public outreach</a>, and <a href="policy.html" title="policy">science policy work</a>. Our approach is highly inter-disciplinaryâ€”META/e <a href="members.html" title="members">members</a> come from a wide range of backgrounds, including psychology, statistics, science policy, innovation science, and the history, philosophy and sociology of science.
